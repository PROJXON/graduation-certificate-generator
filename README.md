# Graduation Certificate Generator

The purpose of this application is to generate certificates for the successful completion of the PROJXON Momentum Internship Program. It works by taking user input for the participant name and completion date, then overlays this information over an image template and generates a pdf for the user. This should hopefully reduce time needed to create certificates.

Written with C#/.NET, the GUI for this application was created using Avalonia to allow for its usage on any operating system.
